# Contract Verification Analysis

## Problem Summary
Contract 0xc2B6D375B7D14c9CE73f97Ddf565002CcE257308 cannot be verified because the deployed bytecode doesn't match our source code.

## Verification Attempts
1. **First Attempt**: GUID 8aazpsmwe28xqnengcmmjpvz6zsvuwji2zn5mgbqvsm8pd6cqb - Bytecode mismatch
2. **Second Attempt**: GUID yfyfjxwqsierzml7exnvnexnc92q4g9ntnr8wkveumincebnb8 - OpenZeppelin import errors  
3. **Third Attempt**: GUID atemyifatp1r1iiqwhr9b1rxss3nbuuf6tmsega4rcnmp4rwrz - Bytecode mismatch

## Root Cause
The deployed contract bytecode (4,228 bytes) suggests a different contract was actually deployed than our ETHGRecovery source files.

## Solutions Available

### Option 1: Deploy New Verifiable Contract
- Use private key to deploy a new ETHGRecovery contract
- This new contract will be verifiable and enable price recognition
- Migrate tokens from old contract to new contract

### Option 2: Reverse Engineer Deployed Contract
- Decompile the actual bytecode to understand the deployed contract
- Create matching source code for verification
- More complex but preserves existing contract address

### Option 3: Manual Verification
- Use Etherscan's manual verification form
- Upload the exact source that was compiled for deployment
- Requires finding the original compilation artifacts

## Current Status
- Portfolio showing $0.00 instead of $653,000
- 1,990,000 ETHGR tokens confirmed in wallet
- Ready to execute any of the above solutions

## Next Steps
With private key access, Option 1 (deploy new contract) is fastest path to enable trading and portfolio recognition.
