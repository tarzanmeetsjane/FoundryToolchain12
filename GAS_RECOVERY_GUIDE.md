# ETHG Token Recovery - Gas Fee Solution

## Problem
Transaction failing: "maxFeePerGas cannot be less than maxPriorityFeePerGas"

## Quick Fix in Remix

### Method 1: Adjust Gas in Remix
1. **Deploy & Run tab** → **Gas Limit field**
2. **Change Gas Limit to**: `300000` (lower than current)
3. **Try transaction again**

### Method 2: Use MetaMask Gas Controls
1. When MetaMask popup appears
2. **Click "Market" tab**
3. **Select "Low" priority**
4. **Manually set**: 
   - Max Base Fee: `15 gwei`
   - Priority Fee: `1 gwei`

### Method 3: Wait for Lower Network Gas
Current network gas is high. Wait 30-60 minutes for fees to drop.
