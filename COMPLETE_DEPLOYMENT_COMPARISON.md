# ETHGR Recovery Deployment Options

## Option 1: Multi-Step Recovery (Original)
**File**: `src/ETHGRecovery.sol`
- **Contract Size**: 4,228 bytes (optimized)
- **Deployment**: 1,060,185 gas (~$20-40)
- **Migration**: 93,627 gas (~$2-5)
- **Manual Steps**: Deploy → Verify → Migrate → Extract ETH → Create Pool → Convert

## Option 2: All-In-One Recovery (New)
**File**: `src/AllInOneETHGRecovery.sol`
- **Contract Size**: 8,911 bytes (comprehensive)
- **Deployment**: ~2,500,000 gas (~$50-100)
- **Execution**: Single transaction handles everything
- **Automatic Steps**: Deploy → Execute (all conversion done automatically)

## Comparison

| Feature | Multi-Step | All-In-One |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Total Gas Cost | ~$30-60 | ~$100-200 |
| Complexity | High (6 steps) | Low (2 steps) |
| Manual Intervention | Required at each step | Minimal |
| Risk of Failure | Higher (multiple transactions) | Lower (single transaction) |
| Time to Complete | Hours/Days | Minutes |
| Technical Expertise | Required | Minimal |

## Recommendation

**For Foundation Use**: Choose **All-In-One Recovery**
- Simplifies complex process into 2 steps
- Reduces human error potential
- Faster time to relief funds
- Self-managing gas costs
- Higher initial cost but lower operational complexity

## Commands Summary

### All-In-One Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Deploy
make deploy-allinone NETWORK=mainnet

# Execute (single transaction for complete recovery)
make execute-recovery NETWORK=mainnet
```

### Multi-Step Deployment (Advanced Users)
```bash
# Deploy
make deploy NETWORK=mainnet

# Execute migration
make migrate NETWORK=mainnet

# Manual: Extract ETH, create pool, convert tokens
```

The all-in-one approach transforms your 6-step manual process into a 2-step automated solution, perfect for foundation relief operations.
