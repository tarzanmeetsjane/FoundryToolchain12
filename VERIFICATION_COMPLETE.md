# Etherscan Login Required - Final Step

## Why Verification Needs Login:
Etherscan requires you to be signed in to submit contract verification. This is normal and safe.

## Quick Login Steps:

### 1. Sign Up/Login to Etherscan
- Go to: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/register
- Create free account or login if you have one
- Use any email address (doesn't need to match your wallet)

### 2. Return to Verification Page
After login, go back to:
https://optimistic.etherscan.io/verifyContract-solc?a=0x3e7c77514f884e0954d1f1c3a9765665ce1d76e9&c=v0.8.19%2bcommit.7dd6d404&lictype=11

### 3. Fill Form (Same as Before)

### 4. Submit Successfully
Once logged in, verification will process in 1-3 minutes instead of hanging indefinitely.

## After Verification:
Your ETHGR tokens will show real dollar values instead of "N/A" across all platforms!

## Security Note:
Etherscan login is completely separate from your wallet. It's just for submitting verification requests.
