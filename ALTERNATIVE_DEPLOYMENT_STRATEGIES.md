# Alternative Deployment Strategies

## Creative Funding Solutions

### Option 1: Deploy with Create2 (Deterministic Address)
- Deploy contract using CREATE2 for predictable address
- Fund the contract address before deployment
- Use contract's ETH for subsequent operations

### Option 2: Multi-Step Deployment
1. Deploy minimal proxy contract (very low gas)
2. Use existing funds to upgrade to full contract
3. Leverage delegation patterns

### Option 3: Gasless Deployment via Relayer
- Use a gas relayer service
- Pay fees after deployment from contract itself
- Services like Biconomy or OpenZeppelin Defender

### Option 4: Layer 2 Deployment First
- Deploy on Polygon/Arbitrum (much lower costs)
- Bridge tokens to mainnet later
- Total cost: ~$1-2 instead of $75

### Option 5: Use Existing Token Holdings
- Convert some existing ETHG tokens to ETH
- Fund deployment from current holdings
- Self-financing approach

## Immediate Low-Cost Option: Polygon Deployment

Deploy on Polygon for ~$0.50 total cost:
```bash
# Add Polygon network to Hardhat config
polygon: {
  url: "https://polygon-rpc.com/",
  accounts: ['0xa5ed71406d5a0be4fb9fe9ba2ff4addf51f01922688bc1eabf51ab92fbfe694f'],
  gasPrice: 30000000000, // 30 gwei
}
```

Benefits:
- Immediate deployment and verification
- Portfolio recognition still works
- Bridge to mainnet later if needed
- Costs under $1 total

Would you like me to implement the Polygon deployment approach?
