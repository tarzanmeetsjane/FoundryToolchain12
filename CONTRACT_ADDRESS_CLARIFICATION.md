# Contract Address Analysis

## Current Working Address:
0x3e7c77514f884e0954d1f1c3a9765665ce1d76e9 (Optimism)

## New Address Provided:
0x828e614715BA6bbD32464E4aF5529a1263FB914d

## Analysis Needed:
1. Is this a different contract deployment?
2. Is this the actual contract that needs verification?
3. Is this related to the bytecode mismatch issue?

## Verification Status:
- Previous contract: Bytecode mismatch detected
- New contract: Needs analysis

## Next Steps:
1. Verify which contract address is correct
2. Check deployment details for new address
3. Update verification process accordingly
4. Ensure we're working with the right contract for ETHGR token verification
