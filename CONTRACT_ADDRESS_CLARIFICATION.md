# Contract Address Clarification - Multiple ETHGR Contracts

## Your Contract Addresses

Based on your project documentation, you have multiple ETHGR contracts:

### Contract 1: 0xc2B6D375B7D14c9CE73f97Ddf565002CcE257308
- **Status**: Successfully deployed 
- **Deployment Transaction**: 0xd94f93577d44334d5c302a9dafb62f72925fe475a628bdfbc6f2d0c01240c169
- **Block**: 22,827,519
- **Initial Supply**: 1,990,000 ETHGR tokens minted to your wallet
- **Your Reference**: 0xc2B6...7308

### Contract 2: 0xfA7b8c553C48C56ec7027d26ae95b029a2abF247
- **Status**: Verified with price recognition
- **Current Price**: $0.00451229
- **Market Cap**: $4,201.96
- **Holders**: 22,134+

## The Issue

You're seeing price changes but it's unclear which contract is being tracked by:
- Your wallet application
- Price tracking services  
- Market data platforms

## Immediate Action Required

### Step 1: Verify Which Contract Your Wallet Tracks
Check your wallet to see which ETHGR contract address it displays:
- Does it show 0xc2B6...7308?
- Does it show 0xfA7b...2abF247?
- Or does it show the old honeypot 0x3fC2...70EAD?

### Step 2: Confirm Token Balance Location
Your 1,990,000 ETHGR tokens should be in the contract that was deployed (0xc2B6...7308) since that's where the initial minting occurred according to your deployment records.

### Step 3: Price Tracking Alignment
We need to ensure price services recognize the correct contract where your actual tokens reside.

## Which Contract Should We Focus On?

Based on your deployment documentation:
- **Your tokens are in**: 0xc2B6D375B7D14c9CE73f97Ddf565002CcE257308
- **This should be the primary contract** for price tracking
- The other contracts may be test versions or different deployments

Please confirm which contract address shows in your wallet when you view your ETHGR token balance.
