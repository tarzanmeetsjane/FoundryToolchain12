- Liquidate profitable positions

#### Option 2: LP Token Liquidation
Multiple LP positions from your zero-configuration bots:
- Identify highest-value LP tokens
- Calculate current position values
- Liquidate 1-2 positions for funding

#### Option 3: Phased Deployment
Start with available funds and scale up:
- Deploy with $20 initial liquidity
- Use revenue generation to bootstrap
- Gradually increase pool size

#### Option 4: Alternative Funding Sources
- Review DeFi yield farming positions
- Check staking rewards
- Analyze arbitrage bot profits

```

### 3. Alternative Bot Wallets
Your bots may have generated additional wallets with accumulated funds.

## Modified Deployment Strategy

If immediate full funding isn't available:

### Minimal Viable Deployment
1. Deploy ETHGRBase contract on Base L2 (~$5)
2. Create minimal liquidity pool with available ETH
3. Use automated revenue generation to bootstrap
4. Reinvest trading fees into larger pool

### Benefits of Minimal Start
- Proves concept with 90% cost savings
- Establishes market value for ETHGR tokens
- Begins revenue generation immediately
- Lower risk while building momentum

## Next Steps

1. **Asset Discovery**: Upload additional bot data
2. **Position Analysis**: Check LP token values
3. **Deployment Decision**: Choose full or phased approach
4. **Base L2 Migration**: Execute chosen strategy

The 90% cost reduction on Base L2 makes even a small-scale deployment viable, with potential to scale using generated revenues.
