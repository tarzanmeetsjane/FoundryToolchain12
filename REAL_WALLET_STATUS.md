# Real Wallet Status Analysis

## Current Issue
User reports ETHGR token value showing as zero on Etherscan despite:
- Wallet showing $709,012.93 total value
- Recent transactions with ETHGR contract (0xc2B6D375B7D14c9CE73f97Ddf565002CcE257308)
- Platform analyzing contract as legitimate (8.5/10 security score)

## Possible Explanations

### 1. Token Balance vs Display Value
- Token balance may exist but price data not available
- Etherscan may not have pricing data for this specific token
- Contract may be legitimate but illiquid

### 2. Contract Status Issues
- Token may not be actively trading
- No established market price on major DEXs
- Liquidity pool issues

### 3. Display/API Issues
- Etherscan API delays in updating token data
- Price feeds not connected for this contract
- Display formatting issues

## Investigation Needed
1. Check actual token balance (not just value)
2. Verify if tokens exist in wallet
3. Check if contract has active trading pairs
4. Investigate liquidity pool status

## User's Real Situation
- Has substantial $709k portfolio
- Recently active with ETHGR contract transactions
- Needs clarity on actual token holdings vs displayed value
- Zero value display may not mean zero tokens
