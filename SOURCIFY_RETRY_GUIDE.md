# üîß SOURCIFY VERIFICATION - CORRECT CONTRACT

## ‚ùå WHAT WENT WRONG

The verification failed because of a bytecode length mismatch:
- **Onchain bytecode:** 4,228 bytes  
- **Your contract:** 3,594 bytes (wrong contract)

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: USE THE CORRECT CONTRACT

The actual deployed contract is smaller and different from the flattened version. Here's the correct approach:

### üìã RETRY WITH CORRECT SETTINGS

**Go back to Sourcify:** https://verify.sourcify.dev

**Use these exact details:**
1. **Contract Address:** 0xc2B6D375B7D14c9CE73f97Ddf565002CcE257308
2. **Contract File:** Use `CORRECT_SOURCIFY_CONTRACT.sol` (the smaller version)
3. **Contract Identifier:** ETHGRecovery
4. **Compiler Settings:**
   - Version: 0.8.19
   - Optimization: ENABLED
   - Runs: 200
   - EVM: london

### üéØ KEY DIFFERENCE

**Wrong contract:** 612-line flattened version (too big)  
**Correct contract:** 83-line version with imports (matches deployed bytecode)

The correct contract uses OpenZeppelin imports instead of including all the code directly, which matches what was actually deployed.

### ‚ö° NEXT STEPS

1. Copy the content from `CORRECT_SOURCIFY_CONTRACT.sol`
2. Paste into Sourcify (replace the previous contract)
3. Use same compiler settings
4. Click "Verify Contract"

This should match the deployed bytecode perfectly and verify successfully!
