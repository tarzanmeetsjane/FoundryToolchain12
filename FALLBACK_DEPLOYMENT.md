# Fallback Deployment Method

Since automated deployment encountered issues, here's the manual approach:

## Method 1: Direct Transaction
Use MetaMask or any wallet to send this transaction:
- To: (leave empty for contract creation)
- Data: 0x608060405234801561001057600080fd5b50336000...
- Gas Limit: 2,000,000
- Gas Price: 1 gwei

## Method 2: Remix IDE
1. Go to remix.ethereum.org
2. Create ETHGRecoverySimple.sol
3. Paste the contract code
4. Deploy with your wallet

Both methods will create the same verifiable contract.
