- **Price Recognition**: 24-48 hours for CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap
- **Full Integration**: 1-2 weeks for all price tracking services

## Result:
Your ETHGR tokens will show real dollar values instead of "N/A" across all platforms!

## Why This Works:
Verification tells blockchain explorers what your contract is, enabling price tracking services to recognize and price your ETHGR tokens properly.
