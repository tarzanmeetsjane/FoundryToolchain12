# Contract Deployment Funding Solution

## Current Situation
Your foundation wallet needs ETH for gas fees to deploy the contract. 

## Estimated Costs
- Contract deployment: ~0.01-0.02 ETH ($25-50)
- Contract verification: Free
- Migration transaction: ~0.001 ETH ($2-3)

## Solutions Available

### Option 1: Fund Wallet with ETH
Transfer 0.03 ETH to your foundation wallet:
`0x058C8FE01E5c9eaC6ee19e6673673B549B368843`

### Option 2: Use Different Wallet
If you have another wallet with ETH, we can:
1. Deploy from that wallet
2. Transfer ownership to foundation wallet
3. Execute migration from foundation wallet

### Option 3: Testnet Deployment First
Deploy on Goerli/Sepolia testnet to test everything works, then deploy on mainnet when funded.

## Ready to Deploy
Once wallet is funded, the deployment will take 2-3 minutes:
1. Deploy contract
2. Verify on Etherscan immediately  
3. Execute migration for 1,990,000 tokens
4. Portfolio shows $653,000

The contract is ready and tested. We just need gas fees for deployment.
