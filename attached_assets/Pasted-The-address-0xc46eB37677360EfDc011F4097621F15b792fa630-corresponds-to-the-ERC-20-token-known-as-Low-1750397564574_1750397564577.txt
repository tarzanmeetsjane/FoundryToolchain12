Answer
I could not find any games that accept Ethereum Games token as a form of payment or in-game currency. As mentioned previously, the token is likely associated with scam activity and has been referred to as an "unverified" contract.

Popular Ethereum blockchain games include Big Time, Virtual Protocol, Gala Games and The Sandbox. These games offer features such as trading and collecting NFTs, and often have their own native tokens.

Answer
TokenA is associated with the blockchain game My Neighbor Alice, which is a play-to-earn game where players can purchase and own virtual land, build their own virtual worlds and earn tokens by selling in-game items and content. Players can also socialise and collaborate with others. The token, called "ALICE", has a circulating supply of just under 4 million and a market cap of around $2 million.

TokenB corresponds to the Binance Coin (BNB), which is the native coin of the Binance Chain and is also used on the Binance Smart Chain. BNB has a high market capitalisation of around $35 billion. The coin can be used for paying fees on the Binance exchange, and for gaming and paying for goods and services.

Binance Coin is a well-established, utility coin with real-world use cases, whereas My Neighbor Alice's token ALICE appears to have a smaller market cap and is likely used for in-game purchases and rewards.
