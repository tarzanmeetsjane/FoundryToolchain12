I can see the contract address validation is failing. Let me fix the address validation logic to properly handle the contract address you provided.


Opened server/services/blockchain-service.ts
The address validation is working correctly, but let me check if there's an issue with the ethers.js validation. Let me test the specific address you provided and fix any validation issues.


Executed node -e " const { ethers } = require('ethers'); try { const addr = '0xc2B6D375B7D14c9CE73f97Ddf565002CcE257308'; console.log('Original:', addr); console.log('Valid address:', ethers.getAddress(addr)); console.log('Validation passed'); } catch (err) { console.error('Validation failed:', err.message); } "

The address validation passes correctly, so the issue must be elsewhere. Let me check the security analyzer code to see where the validation error is occurring.


Opened server/services/security-analyzer.ts
I need to examine the exact validation logic being used. Let me check the blockchain service validateAddress method and see what's causing the validation to fail.


Opened server/services/blockchain-service.ts
Let me debug this validation issue by adding some logging to see exactly what's happening with the address validation.


Edited server/services/security-analyzer.ts

Opened client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx
Now I'll test the application with your contract address to see what validation logs appear and fix the issue.


Executed curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/analyze-token \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{"contractAddress": "0xc2B6D375B7D14c9CE73f97Ddf565002CcE257308", "network": "ethereum"}'
