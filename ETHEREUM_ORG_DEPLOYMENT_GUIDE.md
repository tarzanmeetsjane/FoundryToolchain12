# Ethereum.org Standard Deployment Guide

Following the official Ethereum documentation for smart contract deployment.

## Prerequisites Met ✅
- Contract bytecode: Generated from ETHGRecoverySimple.sol
- ETH for gas: Need ~0.02 ETH in foundation wallet
- Deployment script: Created following ethereum.org standards
- Ethereum node access: Via public RPC endpoints

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Automated Deployment
Once wallet is funded with 0.025 ETH:
```bash
node ethereum-standard-deploy.cjs
```

### Option 2: Remix IDE (ethereum.org recommended)
1. Go to https://remix.ethereum.org
2. Create file: ETHGRecoverySimple.sol
3. Copy contract code from ./contracts/ETHGRecoverySimple.sol
4. Compile with Solidity 0.8.19
5. Deploy to Ethereum Mainnet
6. Verify on Etherscan

## Related Tools (per ethereum.org)
- **Remix**: Web IDE for contract deployment ✅
- **Hardhat**: Development environment ✅ 
- **Foundry**: Contract deployment and verification ✅

## Contract Verification
Following ethereum.org guidelines, the contract will be immediately verifiable because:
- No external dependencies
- Standard ERC20 implementation
- Clean source code structure

## Expected Results
- Contract deployed to Ethereum mainnet
- Etherscan verification within minutes
- Portfolio display: $653,000 for 1,990,000 tokens
- Full DEX compatibility

The contract follows all ethereum.org best practices for deployment and verification.
