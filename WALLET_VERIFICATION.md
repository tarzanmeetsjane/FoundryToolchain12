# Wallet Verification Results

## Derivation Path Analysis
- **Path**: m/44'/60'/0'/0/0 (standard Ethereum derivation)
- **Private Key**: 0xa5ed71406d5a0be4fb9fe9ba2ff4addf51f01922688bc1eabf51ab92fbfe694f
- **Expected Address**: 0x058C8FE01E5c9eaC6ee19e6673673B549B368843

## Wallet Status Check
The private key and derivation path confirm this is your foundation wallet. The deployment is technically ready, we just need sufficient gas fees.

## Deployment Strategy
Since gas fees are the only blocker, here are the most practical approaches:

### Option 1: Minimal Funding
Transfer 0.025 ETH (~$60) to foundation wallet for immediate deployment

### Option 2: Remix IDE Deployment
Use Remix with any funded wallet, then transfer ownership

### Option 3: Layer 2 Alternative
Deploy on Polygon/Arbitrum for ~$1 cost instead of $60

## Contract Ready Status
