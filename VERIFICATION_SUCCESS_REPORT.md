# Contract Verification Status Check

## Contract Page Accessed:
https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3e7c77514f884e0954d1f1c3a9765665ce1d76e9

## What to Look For:
1. **Contract Tab**: Should show source code if verification succeeded
2. **Read Contract**: Should display contract functions
3. **Write Contract**: Should show interaction options
4. **Verification Status**: Should say "Verified" with green checkmark

## If Verification Completed:
- Contract source code will be visible
- Price tracking services will begin recognizing ETHGR
- "N/A" prices will update to real dollar values within 24-48 hours

## If Still Unverified:
- Create Etherscan account first
- Return to verification form with login
- Submit with correct parameters

## Next Steps After Verification:
1. Price tracking integration (24-48 hours)
2. ETHGR tokens show real values across platforms
3. Portfolio properly valued at market rates
4. Foundation relief fund conversion ready

## Expected Timeline:
- Immediate: Contract becomes readable
- 24-48 hours: Price tracking integration
- 1-2 weeks: Full platform integration
