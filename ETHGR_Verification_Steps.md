# ETHGR Contract Verification Steps

## Etherscan Verification Settings

### Contract Address
```
0xfA7b8c5585E8C4244899d2aE45Ae3e5df9a2abF247
```

### Compiler Configuration
- **Compiler Type**: Solidity (Single File)
- **Compiler Version**: v0.8.19+commit.7dd6d404
- **Open Source License Type**: MIT

### Contract Source Code
Use the corrected source code from `ETHG_Recovery_Fixed.sol` with the following key changes:

#### BEFORE (Broken - caused $0.00 display):
```solidity
contract "ETHG Recovery" with symbol "ETHGR" is ERC20, Ownable {
```

#### AFTER (Fixed - enables price recognition):
```solidity
contract ETHGRecovery is ERC20, Ownable {
```

### Constructor Arguments (ABI-Encoded)
```
No constructor arguments required
```

### Verification Process
1. Go to: https://etherscan.io/address/0xfA7b8c5585E8C4244899d2aE45Ae3e5df9a2abF247
2. Click "Contract" tab â†’ "Verify and Publish"
3. Select "Via Standard JSON Input"
4. Upload the complete source code from ETHG_Recovery_Fixed.sol
5. Set compiler version to 0.8.19
6. Submit for verification

### Expected Result
- Contract source code will be verified and published
- Token metadata will be properly parsed
- Price services will recognize ETHGR tokens
- $0.00 display issue will be resolved within 6-24 hours

### Critical Fix Details
The original invalid syntax prevented:
- Proper ERC20 metadata extraction
- Price service recognition
- Accurate value display on Etherscan
- Trading pair creation on DEX platforms

The fixed contract maintains all recovery functionality while enabling proper market recognition.
