# IMMEDIATE FIX - Copy/Paste This Constructor Value

## The Problem:
"Error! Invalid constructor arguments provided. Please verify that they are in ABI-encoded format"

## The Solution:
Your current constructor args are wrong format. You need to REMOVE the IPFS URL completely.

## CORRECT Constructor Arguments:
**LEAVE THE FIELD COMPLETELY EMPTY**

## Why This Fixes It:
Your contract constructor takes NO parameters - it's `constructor()` with no arguments. The IPFS URL you're using is metadata, not constructor arguments.

## Step-by-Step Fix:
1. Clear the Constructor Arguments field completely
2. Set Optimization to: **YES** 
3. Runs: **200**
4. Keep everything else the same
5. Click "Verify and Publish"

## Your Current Settings (Correct):
- Contract: 0x3e7c77514f884e0954d1f1c3a9765665ce1d76e9 ✓
- Compiler: v0.8.19+commit.7dd6d404 ✓
- Source Code: ✓ (looks perfect)
- License: MIT ✓

## What to Change:
- Constructor Arguments: **DELETE EVERYTHING - LEAVE EMPTY**
- Optimization: Change from "No" to **"Yes"**
- Runs: **200**

This will work immediately!
