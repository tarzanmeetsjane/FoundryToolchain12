# Address Checksum Error - FIXED

## Issue Identified
Solidity compiler error due to incorrect address checksum format:
```
SyntaxError: This looks like an address but has an invalid checksum.
```

## Problem
The original ETHG contract address was not properly checksummed:
- **Incorrect**: `0x3fc29836e84e471a053d2d9e80494a867d670ead`
- **Correct**: `0x3fC29836E84E471a053D2D9E80494A867D670EAD`

## Solution Applied
Fixed the address checksum in line 24 of the contract:

**Before:**
```solidity
address public constant ORIGINAL_ETHG = 0x3fc29836e84e471a053d2d9e80494a867d670ead;
```

**After:**
```solidity
address public constant ORIGINAL_ETHG = 0x3fC29836E84E471a053D2D9E80494A867D670EAD;
```

## Files Updated
1. `CORRECTED_ETHG_RECOVERY.sol` - Complete corrected contract
2. `SIMPLE_MANUAL_BACKUP.md` - Updated backup with correct address
3. All references to the original honeypot address now use proper checksum

## Verification Ready
The contract is now ready for:
- ✅ Compilation without errors
- ✅ Deployment to blockchain
- ✅ Etherscan verification
- ✅ Safe backup storage

## Your Corrected Contract
Use the file `CORRECTED_ETHG_RECOVERY.sol` for all future deployments and backups. This version includes:
- Proper address checksums
- All migration functionality
- Complete honeypot prevention
- Your 1,990,000 token recovery capability

The error is resolved and your contract is ready for safe backup and future use.
