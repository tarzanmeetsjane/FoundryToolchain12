# CRITICAL: Missing 37 ETH Investigation

## User Report
- Original wallet: 0xc46eb37677360efdc011f4097621f15b792fa630
- Expected transfer: 37 ETH 
- Current status: Cannot locate the 37 ETH anywhere
- Concern: Demo environment may have caused value loss

## Initial Findings
1. **ETH_EXTRACTION_CONTRACT.sol** only references 0.00136014 ETH (not 37 ETH)
2. **Significant discrepancy** between expected (37 ETH) and documented (0.00136014 ETH)
3. **Need immediate investigation** of actual blockchain transactions

## Investigation Steps
1. Check original wallet balance on Ethereum mainnet
2. Review all outgoing transactions from original wallet
3. Trace any large ETH transfers (37 ETH or similar amounts)
4. Verify if transfers occurred during demo/testing phase
5. Check if ETH is held in any intermediate contracts

## Red Flags
- 37 ETH = ~$90,000+ at current prices
- Missing value represents significant financial loss
- Demo environment may have caused real transaction loss
- Need immediate resolution to protect user assets

## Next Actions
- Real blockchain transaction analysis
- Contact exchange/wallet support if needed
- Document all findings for potential recovery
- Determine if value is recoverable or permanently lost
