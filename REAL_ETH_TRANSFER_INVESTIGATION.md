2. **NO EVIDENCE** of 37 ETH ever being in this wallet address
3. **Wallet discrepancy:** User expects 37 ETH, blockchain shows <0.002 ETH total

## Investigation Steps
1. Check original wallet balance on Ethereum mainnet

3. Trace any large ETH transfers (37 ETH or similar amounts)
4. Verify if transfers occurred during demo/testing phase
5. Check if ETH is held in any intermediate contracts

## Red Flags

- Missing value represents significant financial loss
- Demo environment may have caused real transaction loss
- Need immediate resolution to protect user assets

## Next Actions
- Real blockchain transaction analysis
