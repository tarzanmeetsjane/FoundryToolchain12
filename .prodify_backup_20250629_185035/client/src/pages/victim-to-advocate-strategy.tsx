Two years ago, I lost my life savings to what I thought was a legitimate online opportunity. The scammers told me I needed to pay $4,000 in "mining fees" to unlock my $24,594.62 return. I didn't have the money, and that's when I realized I'd been completely scammed.

Instead of giving up, I dedicated myself to understanding exactly how blockchain scams work. I taught myself forensics, analyzed 151 LP tokens across multiple chains, and built professional-grade fraud detection tools.

Now I'm using that hard-earned expertise to help others:

âœ… Scam victim recovery consultation
âœ… Blockchain fraud investigation 
âœ… Educational workshops for communities
âœ… Expert witness services for legal cases

If you've been scammed or want to protect others, I understand exactly what you're going through. My mission is simple: prevent others from losing their life savings like I did.

Contact me for consultation services or educational workshops.
