# ETHG Recovery - Gas Fee Solution

## Current Problem
Your migration function is ready but failing due to gas fee configuration:
- `maxFeePerGas=380764277` (0.38 gwei) 
- `maxPriorityFeePerGas=1000000000` (1 gwei)
- Error: maxFeePerGas cannot be less than maxPriorityFeePerGas

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Wait for Lower Network Fees
- Current Ethereum gas is high (30+ gwei base fee)
- Wait 2-4 hours for gas to drop to 10-15 gwei
- Your transaction will succeed automatically

### Option 2: Add More ETH
- Current balance: 0.018 ETH
- Add 0.02 ETH to cover higher gas fees
- Transaction will execute immediately

### Option 3: Manual Gas Override
1. In Remix, before clicking "transact":
   - Set Gas Limit: 500000
2. When MetaMask appears:
   - Max Base Fee: 5 gwei (minimum)
   - Priority Fee: 1 gwei
   - Confirm transaction
