# Two ETHGR Token Resolution - Which Contract Has Your Real Tokens?

## The Problem
You now have two different ETHGR contracts appearing:
1. **Contract A**: 0xc2b6d375b7d14c9ce73f97ddf565002cce257308
2. **Contract B**: 0xfa7b8c553c48c56ec7027d26ae95b029a2abf247

This creates confusion about which tokens have real value and which are showing price changes.

## Immediate Solution Steps

### Step 1: Check Your Wallet Balance
Open your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) and look for ETHGR tokens:

**If you see Contract A (0xc2b6...7308):**
- Check the balance amount
- This contract was deployed with 1,990,000 tokens minted to your wallet
- If balance shows 1,990,000 ETHGR, this contains your real tokens

**If you see Contract B (0xfa7b...2abf247):**
- Check the balance amount  
- This contract shows verified status with $0.00451229 price
- If balance is different or zero, this may be a tracking/test contract

### Step 2: Determine Which Contract to Focus On
The contract with your **1,990,000 ETHGR token balance** is your real portfolio.

## Most Likely Scenario
Based on your deployment records:
- **Your real tokens**: Contract A (0xc2b6...7308) with 1,990,000 ETHGR
- **Price tracking reference**: Contract B (0xfa7b...2abf247) showing $0.00451229

## Resolution Actions

### Option 1: If Contract A has your tokens
- Focus all wallet tracking on Contract A
- Hide/remove Contract B from wallet view
- Ensure price services track Contract A for your portfolio value

### Option 2: If Contract B has your tokens  
- Focus on Contract B as your main contract
- Use Contract B address for all price tracking
- Hide Contract A if balance is zero

### Option 3: If both have tokens
- Add up total balance across both contracts
- This indicates multiple deployments of your recovery contract
- Both contracts represent your ETHGR holdings

## Quick Check Method
1. **Open your wallet**
2. **Find ETHGR tokens**
3. **Note the contract address and balance**
4. **The contract with 1,990,000 tokens is your main portfolio**

## Next Steps
Once you identify which contract has your 1,990,000 tokens:
1. Update platform to track only that contract
2. Ensure price services recognize the correct contract
3. Hide the other contract to prevent confusion
4. Focus conversion planning on the contract with actual tokens

Your $709k portfolio value is in whichever contract shows your 1,990,000 ETHGR balance.
